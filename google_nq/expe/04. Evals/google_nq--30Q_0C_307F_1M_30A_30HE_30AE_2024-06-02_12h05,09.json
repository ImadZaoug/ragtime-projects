The first part, called G1 phase (2) is marked by synthesis of various enzymes that are required for DNA replication (3). The second part of the cell cycle is the S phase (4), where DNA replication produces two identical sets of chromosomes (5). The third part is the G2 phase (6) in which a significant protein synthesis occurs (7), mainly involving the production of microtubules (8) that are required during the process of division, called mitosis (?). The fourth phase, M phase (9), consists of nuclear division (karyokinesis) (10, 11) and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis) (10, 12), accompanied by the formation of a new cell membrane (13). This is the physical division of 'mother' and 'daughter' cells (14). The M phase has been broken down into several distinct phases (15), sequentially known as prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase (16) leading to cytokinesis (17).",
