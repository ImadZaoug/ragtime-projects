      <!-- Facts -->
      
        <h3>Facts</h3>
        
          <span class="facts">1.</span> During the 19th century, the mass-to-charge ratios of some ions were determined using electrochemical methods.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">2.</span> J. J. Thomson first measured the mass-to-charge ratio of the electron in 1897.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">3.</span> Thomson's measurements proved that the electron is a particle with both mass and charge.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">4.</span> The mass-to-charge ratio of an electron is significantly smaller than that of a hydrogen ion H+.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">5.</span> In 1898, Wilhelm Wien separated ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio using an ion optical device.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">6.</span> This device, known as a Wien filter, utilized both electric and magnetic fields.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">7.</span> Walter Kaufman measured the increase of electromagnetic mass of fast electrons in 1901.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">8.</span> This phenomenon is now referred to as relativistic mass increase.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">9.</span> In 1913, Thomson used a parabola spectrograph to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">10.</span> Today, a mass spectrometer is the instrument used to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of charged particles.<br/>

          <span class="facts">2.</span> The International Olympic Committee (IOC) had a rule that players who had signed an NHL contract but played less than ten games were eligible.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">3.</span> The United States Olympic Committee disagreed, stating that any player with an NHL contract was a professional and thus ineligible.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">4.</span> An emergency meeting was held by the IOC, which ruled that NHL-contracted players were eligible if they hadn't played any NHL games.<br/>

          <span class="facts">9.</span> In 1986, the IOC decided to allow all athletes to compete in the Olympics starting from 1988.<br/>

        <h3>Facts</h3>
        
          <span class="facts">1.</span> Oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes takes place in the mitochondrial cristae.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">2.</span> The process involves the electron transport chain which creates a proton gradient across the inner membrane boundary.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">3.</span> This proton gradient is established by oxidizing NADH, a product of the Krebs cycle.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">4.</span> ATP, an energy molecule, is synthesized by an enzyme called ATP synthase.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">5.</span> The ATP synthase enzyme uses the chemiosmotic gradient to drive the phosphorylation of ADP, a precursor to ATP.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">6.</span> The electrons involved in the process are eventually transferred to oxygen from outside the cell.<br/>
        
          <span class="facts">7.</span> The addition of two protons to the transferred electrons results in the formation of water.<br/>
