Thanks for being here! Glad you wish to contribute!

This repo contains projects built on RagtimeðŸŽ¹.
You can contribute by proposing new ones :)

We have tons of ideas to make this repo grow! Don't hesitate to add other ideas you might have to the list below:
- `RagFull [RF]`: create a full end to end case, with a dataset and a RAG based on LlamaIndex - that would add a retriever in comparison to the Google NQ project - example dataset [here](https://storage.recital.ai/s/ZnIx.GWJqg2ZXgGpPq4o)
- `HuggingFace Leaderboard [HFLB]: create a leaderboard on HuggingFace - [see HF doc](https://huggingface.co/spaces/leaderboards/documentation)
- `TestLang [TL]`: run tests with prompts translated from French to English to see if it has an impact - if so, which generation steps are changed : answers, facts, evaluation?
- `JudgeAndJury [JJ]`: run answer generation, fact generation and evaluation with different LLMs to see their influence - can we measure to what extent the LLM having generated answers and facts is favoured when evaluated?
- 'Documentation [Doc]`: add a wiki in GitHub
